## Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project, please open an issue and provide as much information as possible. This will help us to understand the problem and fix it.

## Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an enhancement to an existing feature, please open an issue and describe the feature you would like to see. We will discuss the idea and decide if it is a good fit for the project.

## Development

General steps to contribute to the project:

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) and install the dependencies. (`pipx install poetry` and `poetry install`)
3. Install [Poe the Poet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) for tasks automation. (`pipx install poethepoet`)
4. Make your changes and run `poe run test` to run the tests.
5. Submit a pull request to the main repository.

### Making Changes

When committing, please also add a line to the `CHANGELOG.md` under the `Unreleased` section, describing the changes you made. This will help the maintainers to write the release notes when the time comes.

Commit messages need to start with a capital letter and a verb in the present tense, describing the change. For example, `Add support for Katakana` or `Fix bug in Cyrillic to Latin conversion`.

### Improving The Documentation

The documentation is located at [docs/](docs/). You can make changes to the documentation by editing the `.rst` files in this directory. The documentation is built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). You can build the documentation locally by running `poetry run make html` in the `docs/` directory.

### Publish a new version
> [!NOTE]  
> You can only publish a new version if you are a maintainer of the project and have the necessary rights to do so.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use `poetry build` to build the package. Instead, use `poe build` to check before build to ensure that the package is ready for release.

- [ ] Bump the version in `pyproject.toml` (`poetry version <version>`)
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` is updated with the new version and the changes made from `Unreleased`.
- [ ] Stage and commit the changes (`git commit -am "Bump version <version>"`)
- [ ] Create a new tag (`git tag -a <version> -m "Version <version>"`) and push it (`git push --tags`)
- [ ] Build and publish the package (`poe build` and `poetry publish`)
- [ ] Create a new release on GitHub with the release notes from `CHANGELOG.md`
